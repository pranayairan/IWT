# IWT: An AI-Generated Interval Walking App

This repository contains the source code for an Interval Walking Training (IWT) Android app, built almost entirely with AI tools. This project was an experiment to see how far AI-driven development could go. The result was a full-featured app built in less than 24 hours, with over 90% of the code written by AI.

This project was inspired by the concept of Interval Walking Training (IWT), a simple and effective fitness method, and the release of new AI-powered development tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools

This project was built using a modern, AI-centric toolchain:

  * **Platform**: Android
  * **Language**: Kotlin
  * **UI Toolkit**: Jetpack Compose
  * **AI Planner**: **Gemini 2.5 Pro** was used to create a detailed project plan, feature list, and screen-by-screen flows from a single prompt.
  * **AI UI Designer**: **Google Stitch** generated the initial app designs and UI based on instructions from the project plan.
  * **Design Tool**: **Figma** was used to refine the AI-generated designs before coding.
  * **AI Code Generator**: **Firebender Composer** converted the Figma designs directly into Jetpack Compose code within Android Studio.
  * **AI Agentic Coder**: **Firebender's agentic tool** was used to write the business logic, create ViewModels, manage dependencies, and even validate the final code based on detailed, step-by-step prompts.

## üöÄ How It Was Built: The AI-Driven Workflow

The development process was centered around a pipeline of AI tools, with human oversight and intervention.

1.  **Crafting the Blueprint with AI**: The project began with a detailed prompt given to Gemini, specifying the app concept, tech stack, and desired features. Gemini produced a comprehensive development plan that served as the foundation for the entire project.
2.  **Designing the UI with a Stitch**: The instructions from Gemini's plan were fed into Google Stitch, which generated a clean, professional UI for the app. Minor manual tweaks were made in Figma to refine the user experience.
3.  **Figma to Code with Firebender**: The finalized Figma designs were imported into Firebender Composer. The tool iteratively generated Jetpack Compose code, comparing its preview against the Figma target to ensure high fidelity.
4.  **Bringing the App to Life with an Agent**: For business logic, Gemini was prompted to create detailed instructions for each screen (e.g., building the ViewModel, handling permissions). These instructions were pasted into Firebender's agentic coding mode, which then wrote, compiled, and tested the code.
5.  **Refining and Validating**: While the AI agent was effective, human oversight was crucial for fixing visual glitches and functional gaps. Targeted prompts were used to refactor code, and a final validation script, also generated by Gemini, was used to test the core logic of the app.

## üí° Lessons Learned

Building an app with AI as a co-developer was an eye-opening experience.

  * **Prompt is King**: The quality of the AI's output is directly proportional to the quality of the input. Detailed, structured prompts yield the best results.
  * **Human-in-the-Loop is Essential**: Agentic tools are excellent at executing instructions but can lack qualitative judgment. A developer's eye is still needed to spot visual imperfections, fix logical gaps, and guide the AI.
  * **AI Quirks**: The tools aren't perfect. The AI sometimes required multiple attempts to get a design right or was overzealous in "fixing" code, requiring manual correction.

Despite the quirks, AI is a massive force multiplier for developers, enabling ideas to become functional products faster than ever.
